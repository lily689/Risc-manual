\chapter{Supervisor Binary Interface (SBI)}

This chapter is a placeholder to describe the form of the SBIs we're
envisioning for the RISC-V supervisor.

The SBI captures the instructions that can be executed together with a
set of SBI calls out to the supervisor execution environment (SEE) on
a given platform.

Several features that might normally handled by the supervisor
operating system (OS) directly are handled via SBI calls to the SEE in
RISC-V, including:

\begin{itemize}

\item Reset is handled by the SEE and once the machine is set up, the
  OS kernel is mapped into virtual memory, and its entry point is called.

\item Machine-check errors and other non-maskable interrupts are
  handled by the SEE before vectoring into the OS if recovery is
  possible.

\item Some device drivers may be handled by the SEE, and managed via
  virtual device calls over the SBI.

\item The presence and version of supported instruction set extensions
  is obtained via an SBI call to return the configuration string
  rather than a machine register.  This allows for an arbitrarily
  large definition of instruction set extensions, and simplifies
  virtualization where the returned machine configuration might be
  modified to emulate different architectures on a given hardware
  platform.

\end{itemize}

The SBI employs the same calling convention as the ABI specified in Volume
I of this manual.  SBI entry points are located in the uppermost
\wunits{2}{KiB} of the virtual address space, so that they may be invoked with
a single {\tt jalr} instruction with {\tt x0} as the base register.

Table~\ref{sbicalls} gives a preliminary list of SBI calls.
